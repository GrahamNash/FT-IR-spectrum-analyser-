# FT-IR-spectrum-analyser-
A simple python app I wrote to get myself aqquinted with the python programming language.
The app illustrates the application of a discrete real Fourier transform algorithm to process raw interferograms produced by a 
Michelson interferometers (such as the ones found in many commercial I.R. spectrometers) into chemically interpretable I.R. spectra.

The GUI and plotting components of the application are based on the pyQt4 and pyqtgraph toolkits. All of the numerical processing functions have been coded from scratch on purpose and don't use built in libraries, this was done for purely educational reasons.

The application has been tested using the following dependencies installed on a new blank anaconda enviroment:
python 2.7.13
qt=4.8.7
pyqt=4.11.4
pyqtgraph=0.10.0

The JCAMP-Reader folder contains a prototype script for opening certain JCAMP I.R. spectra files. The script is still under development and will be integrated intom the main application once support for all JCAMP files have been added.

An excellent introduction to the thery behind the processing of inteferograms generated by FT-I.R. spectrometers can be found at the link below http://www.ccmr.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/11/Understanding_FTIR.pdf .I do not own this material or the server that it is hosted on and merely came across this link with a google search.

Instructions for running the application using an anaconda enviroment:
Installing and setting up conda enviroment:

 1)Download and install miniconda with python 2:

  Windows -> https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe
  Ubuntu -> https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh 
  Platform specific installation instructions https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html
  

  2)type the following into the commandline to install dependencies:
  $conda create --name test1
  $conda install qt=4.8.7
  $conda install pyqt=4.11.4
  $conda install pyqtgraph
 
 3)activate the enviroment(bash/cmd):
  Windows: $activate test1
  Linux: $source activate test1
 *to verify that enviroment has been installed successfully : $conda list -> should display required dependencies

 4)Running and testing the app
 python Start.py
  *An example file containing raw instrumental(interferogram) is provided in the sample folder   for testing purposes.
  The application can also convert proccessed spectra back to theoretical   interferograms to simulate instrumental raw data.



*Removing miniconda from linux -> 
 1)delete miniconda folder
 2)remove "path=/usr/miniconda/bin" line from ./usr/home/.bashrc file :)
